# super_rats
A python program to genetically use a genetic algorithm to simulate breeding rats to an average weight of 50 kilograms.

The goal is to breed bullmastiff-sized rats. Of course there are genetic boundaries which probably make this an impossible task, but fun project.
 
Code prints fitness factor for each "generation" (how close they are to the target weight in grams) as well as average weight (still in grams) of each generation.

Last the programs prints how many generations it would take (with the defined mutation rate) to get to target goal, how many years that would be (if we were able to produce 10 litters a year) and for comparison how long it took for Python to "breed" the rats.

The idea is from Al Sweigarts great book Impractical Python Projects
