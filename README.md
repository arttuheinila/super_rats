# super_rats
A python program to genetically use a genetic algorithm to simulate breeding rats to an average weight of 110 pounds

The goal is to breed bullmastiff-sized rats. Of course there are genetic boundaries which probably make this an impossible task, but fun project.

The idea is from Al Sweigarts great book Impractical Python Projects
